# 1. Use two pointers p1 and p2.
# 2. Move p1 through list A and p2 through list B.
# 3. When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list.
# 4. If the lists intersect, p1 and p2 will eventually meet at the intersection node.
# 5. If they do not intersect, both pointers will reach None at the same time.
