1. Activity Selection / Interval Scheduling
Greedy Idea: Always pick the interval with the earliest finishing time

Popular Problems

	Activity Selection Problem
	Non-overlapping Intervals
	Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
	Interval Scheduling Maximum Meetings
	Meeting Rooms I / II
	Course Schedule III (greedy + heap)
	

2. Scheduling by Sorting

Greedy Idea: Sort jobs based on a key (start time, deadline, duration) and make the locally optimal choice.

Popular Problems
	Job Sequencing with Deadlines
	CPU Task Scheduling
	Shortest Job First / Minimum Waiting Time
	Last Moment Before All Ants Fall
	Assign Cookies
	Minimum Platforms (train scheduling)

3. Greedy on Absolute Maximum / Minimum
Greedy Idea: Pick the max or min element each step.

Popular Problems

	Candy Distribution
	Gas Station (circular tour)
	Jump Game I
	Reduce Array Size to Half
	Largest Sum After K Negations
	Rope Joining (min-cost rope merging)
	
4. Greedy with Priority Queue (Heap)
Greedy Idea: Maintain a heap to always pick the best candidate available.

Popular Problems
	Merge K Sorted Lists
	Reorganize String
	Tasks Scheduler
	Find Median from Data Stream
	Course Schedule III
	K Pairs with Smallest Sums
	
5. Greedy for String Construction
Greedy Idea: Pick lexicographically best or most frequent character.

Popular Problems

	Remove K Digits
	Build the Smallest Number
	Reorganize String
	Longest Happy String
	Partition Labels
	Valid Parentheses with Minimum Removals
	
6. Greedy with Sorting + Sweeping (Sweep Line)
 Greedy Idea: Convert events into +1 / –1 timeline and sweep
 
Popular Problems
	Meeting Rooms II
	Car Pooling
	Employee Free Time
	Skyline Problem (variant)
	Max Concurrent Events
	
7. Coin Change (Classic Greedy)

Greedy Idea: Pick the largest possible coin first (only works for canonical coin systems).

Popular Problems
	Minimum Coins to Make Amount (works for INR/USD denominations)
	Lemonade Change
	Minimum Number of Refueling Stops (greedy + heap)
	
8. Greedy for Arrays (Local Optimization)
Greedy Idea: At each step pick local best to reach global best.

Popular Problems
	Maximum Subsequence Score
	Maximize Array Sum After K Negations
	Distribute Candies
	Increasing Triplet Subsequence (partially greedy)
	
9. Greedy in Graphs
Greedy Idea: Always take the smallest/cheapest edge or node first.

Popular Problems
	Prim’s Algorithm (MST)
	Kruskal’s Algorithm (MST)
	Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)


10. Greedy Compression & Reconstruction
Greedy Idea: Reduce the problem by merging or simplifying.

Popular Problems
	Merge Intervals
	Non-overlapping Intervals
	Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters
	Remove Duplicate Letters
